** https://github.com/UnderRose520/xuperchain-go
## Running steps
### Portal: [Baidu super chain account]（ https://xuper.baidu.com )
```
# Registration: see portal for link
# Switch to the workbench, click "manage contract", and then select Create contract. We can select a contract template suitable for our application scenario and write our contract by referring to the contract template (we have selected the template of student certificate uplink deposit. After selecting the contract template, the code of the template contract needs to be retained, and we need to copy a code for modification, Otherwise, the contract cannot be verified in the uplink contract link. This problem has not been solved.)
# Edit the contract as soon as it is created
# Write the contract code in xuperstudio. After writing, click the green button to compile. After the compilation does not report an error, the contract can be linked by clicking the orange button.
# During contract deployment, you need to fill in initialization parameters, as shown in the figure below. You need to fill in your own Baidu super chain account. After verification, you can install our contract. After installing the contract, we can call it.
# After the successful deployment on Baidu super chain platform, we can use go to build our back-end server to call the contract. The back-end server built by go is responsible for the data interaction between the front-end and Baidu super chain platform.
